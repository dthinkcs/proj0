                <p>Life is a tennis match.</p>
                <p>Coaches teach you plays, strategies, strokes, footwork, technique…</p>
                <p>But you, yourself, are in control.</p>
                <p>You utilize every skill you have learned, but most importantly you keep your mind in check.</p>
                <p>Tennis is a mentally challenging game.</p>
                <p>Sure speed, agility, and power are essential,</p>
                <p>But composure, control, confidence, and motivation are just as crucial.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Life is a tennis match.</p>
                <p>You have coaches and trainers helping you learn everything there is to know. They push you to condition until your movement ceases,</p>
                <p>But in the end…</p>
                <p>It’s up to YOU alone and no one else to take the shot at victory.</p>
                <p>Of course you have a team rooting for you and hoping you succeed,</p>
                <p>but you and your opponent control the ball,</p>
                <p>and YOU control your destiny.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Life is a tennis match.</p>
                <p>You start as a child in school.</p>
                <p>Your teachers and parents teach you simple things.</p>
                <p>As you progress and become more knowledgeable,</p>
                <p>their expectations rise,</p>
                <p>as does the difficulty in completion and success.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Life is a tennis match.</p>
                <p>When you start out with tennis,</p>
                <p>coaches teach you the basics,</p>
                <p>and you work to perfect them.</p>
                <p>The variety of strokes…</p>
                <p>The direction you hit the ball on the courts…</p>
                <p>The spin you apply…</p>
                <p>All have to be perfected, or at the very least consistent, in order for you to use them—accurately.</p>
                <p>As you progress and become better,</p>
                <p>your challengers become more difficult to defeat.</p>
                <p>Some matches you are triumphant!</p>
                <p>Some, you win by miles. It hardly takes raising a finger to conquer, it seems.</p>
                <p>Others… your skill level was no match for your opponent’s,</p>
                <p>OR maybe you could not master your mind that day.</p>
                <p>The court has no tolerance for rash behavior.</p>
                <p>No room or time for clouded thoughts.</p>
                <p>No emotional distraction is permitted to the smallest degree.</p>
                <p>Reflexes have to be instantaneous,</p>
                <p>as there is no time for any slight mistake.</p>
                <p>One irresponsible move or shot…</p>
                <p>BAM!</p>
                <p>Before you realize it…</p>
                <p>Game, Set, Match.</p>
                <p>You lose.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Life is a tennis match.</p>
                <p>We will all have our wins and losses in life.</p>
                <p>Some losses will come because we are not experienced enough to overcome it,</p>
                <p>or our skills are not quite seasoned in that particular area.</p>
                <p>As in a match, you will always have a cheering section.</p>
                <p>They want you to make the best decisions possible to ensure your success.</p>
                <p>They want you to accomplish everything, to take on the world and come back victorious.</p>
                <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Your opponent can never be sized up just by looking at them.</p>
                <p>In tennis, looks can be deceiving—as are challenges in life.</p>
                <p>Things come unexpectedly, but it is your choice whether or not you fight to win.</p>
                <p>To learn and to grow. To come off conqueror.</p>
                <p>It is up to you, and you alone.</p>
                <p>Live The Match</p>
